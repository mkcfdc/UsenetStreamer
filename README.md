# UsenetStreamer

![UsenetStreamer logo](public/assets/icon.png)

UsenetStreamer is a Stremio addon that bridges Prowlarr and NZBDav. It hosts no
media itself; it simply orchestrates search and streaming through your existing
Usenet stack. The addon searches Usenet indexers via Prowlarr, queues NZB
downloads in NZBDav, and exposes the resulting media as Stremio streams.

### This Version uses Deno. Not Node.

## Features

- ID-aware search plans (IMDb/TMDB/TVDB) with automatic metadata enrichment.
- Parallel Prowlarr queries with deduplicated NZB aggregation.
- Direct WebDAV streaming from NZBDav (no local mounts required).
- Configurable via environment variables (see `.env.example`).
- Fallback failure clip when NZBDav cannot deliver media.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Prowlarr/NZBDav credentials
   and addon base URL.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   deno install
   ```

3. Start the addon:

   ```bash
   deno task dev
   ```

### Docker Usage

The image is published to the GitHub Container Registry. Pull it and run with
your environment variables:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sanket9225/usenetstreamer:latest

docker run -d \
   --name usenetstreamer \
   -p 7000:7000 \
   -e PROWLARR_URL=https://your-prowlarr-host:9696 \
   -e PROWLARR_API_KEY=your-prowlarr-api-key \
   -e NZBDAV_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
   -e NZBDAV_API_KEY=your-nzbdav-api-key \
   -e NZBDAV_WEBDAV_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
   -e NZBDAV_WEBDAV_USER=webdav-username \
   -e NZBDAV_WEBDAV_PASS=webdav-password \
   -e ADDON_BASE_URL=https://myusenet.duckdns.org \
   ghcr.io/sanket9225/usenetstreamer:latest
```

If you prefer to keep secrets in a file, use
`--env-file /path/to/usenetstreamer.env` instead of specifying `-e` flags.

## Environment Variables

- `PROWLARR_URL`, `PROWLARR_API_KEY`, `PROWLARR_STRICT_ID_MATCH`
- `NZBDAV_URL`, `NZBDAV_API_KEY`, `NZBDAV_WEBDAV_URL`, `NZBDAV_WEBDAV_USER`,
  `NZBDAV_WEBDAV_PASS`
- `ADDON_BASE_URL`

`PROWLARR_STRICT_ID_MATCH` defaults to `false`. Set it to `true` if you want
strictly ID-based searches (IMDb/TVDB/TMDB only). This usually yields faster,
more precise matches but many indexers do not support ID queries, so you will
receive fewer total results.

See `.env.example` for the authoritative list.

### Choosing an `ADDON_BASE_URL`

`ADDON_BASE_URL` must be a **public HTTPS domain** that points to your addon
deployment. Stremio refuses insecure origins, so you must front the addon with
TLS before adding it to the catalog. DuckDNS + Let's Encrypt is an easy path,
but any domain/CA combo works.

1. **Grab a DuckDNS domain (free):**
   - Sign in at [https://www.duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org) with
     GitHub/Google/etc.
   - Choose a subdomain (e.g. `myusenet.duckdns.org`) and note the token DuckDNS
     gives you.
   - Run their update script (cron/systemd/timer) so the domain always resolves
     to your server’s IP.

2. **Serve the addon over HTTPS (non-negotiable):**
   - Place Nginx, Caddy, or Traefik in front of the Node server.
   - Issue a certificate:
     - **Let’s Encrypt** with certbot, lego, or Traefik’s built-in ACME
       integration for a trusted cert.
     - DuckDNS also provides an ACME helper if you prefer wildcard certificates.
   - Terminate TLS at the proxy and forward requests from
     `https://<your-domain>` to `http://127.0.0.1:7000` (or your chosen port).
   - Expose `/manifest.json`, `/stream/*`, `/nzb/*`, and `/assets/*`. Stremio
     will reject plain HTTP URLs.

3. **Update `.env`:** set `ADDON_BASE_URL=https://myusenet.duckdns.org` and
   restart the addon so manifests reference the secure URL. Stremio will only
   load the addon when `ADDON_BASE_URL` points to a valid HTTPS domain.

Tips:

- Keep port 7000 (or whichever you use) firewalled; let the reverse proxy handle
  public traffic.
- Renew certificates automatically (cron/systemd timer or your proxy’s
  auto-renew feature).
- If you deploy behind Cloudflare or another CDN, ensure WebDAV/body sizes are
  allowed and HTTPS certificates stay valid.
- Finally, add `https://myusenet.duckdns.org/manifest.json` (replace with your
  domain) to Stremio’s addon catalog. Use straight HTTPS—the addon will not show
  up over HTTP.

### Features added:

1. Rewrote using Deno 2.5 web ready API's where possible to reduce dependencies.
2. Redis JSON Caching for every outside API (Cinemeta, Prowlarr)
3. Auto delete bad lookups. A file fails, delete it from the cache..
4. Secure API Keys so they are not shared in URLS.
5. Uses the redis streams: cache to prevent downloading the same thing 500
   times... ooops!
6. Code split so it's easier to follow.
7. Now ES7 compliant.
8. Uses the webdav module to push the videos to Streaming, reducing the amount
   of code.

### Features missing in this version:

1. Only works with Prowlarr so far since that's what I've always used and that's
   how Sanket9225 originally released.
2. I think I'm missing some spots where the error video should show..
3. My result filtering sucks compared to Sanket9225.. need to spend more time
   there.
